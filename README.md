# Bird Song Classifier

This project aims to classify bird songs using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of audio recordings of various bird species along with metadata. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction, and model training.

## Project Structure

- `FINAL_PROJECT.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
- `train_metadata.csv`: Metadata for the training audio files.
- `eBird_Taxonomy_v2021.csv`: Taxonomy information for the bird species.
- `train_audio/`: Directory containing the training audio files.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.12.3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- torch
- librosa
- torchaudio
- plotly


## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Load the metadata and audio files.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for model training.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the audio files.
5. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to classify bird songs.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models.
